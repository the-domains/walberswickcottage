Elm Gables is a lovely family home in the popular village of Walberswick.   
The house is located at the entrance to the village and next to the church, with a large gated and mature garden, which makes the house very private.

**Washing Facilities**

There is a separate wash house in the garden with a washing machine and separate drier, the key is on the key rack in the conservatory.

**Garden**

The garden which is looked after by our gardener Mark has large lawn areas ideal for the kids to run around on, surrounded mature flower beds and a high fence with a gate that can be closed for additional security should you wish. There is a hard terrace with table and chairs to enjoy a cup of tea or something stronger, it is also ideal to enjoy lunch or dinner when the weather allows.

We also provide a BBQ, if you do use it could you please leave clean for the next guests.

There is a herb garden which depending on the season will add some fresh flavours to your cooking.

There is a decent parking area at the entrance to the house with space for up to three cars.

**Water**

There is a water softener for additional comfort, this is used through out the house except for the third green tap on the kitchen sink which is filtered drinking water, seems hard water is good for you!

**Fire place**

This is a 'Baxi' working fire place, with venting system, the less venting, the less coal you will get through, we really love using it in winter as it provides a lovely atmosphere and heat, but please use your common sense, we provide a fire guard and its best if this is used at all times, coal can sometimes spit.

We provide a 20kg bag of coal for your stay, if you would like any additional bags at Â£10 each please let us know. You can also buy coal bags, wood and kindling at the petrol station at Wangford, this is on the A12 on the way to Lowestoft.

**Central heating**

There is oil fired central heating, the house is very well insulated with double glazing through out and so requires little heating, there is a thermostat in the entrance hall on the ground floor please adjust it for your own comfort. We have the boiler serviced regularly, so in the unlikely event of there being a problem let us know. In summer the heating is unnecessary, so the hot water runs from the electric emersion tank, this also keep the towel rail in the bathrooms warm as well if you were wondering!

**Cleaning**

Joe and his team at make sure the house is in tip top condition, they will come in on change over day and clean the house from top to bottom. They change the linen and towels and make sure there are starter packs of dishwasher tablets, washing up liquid, and loo roll.

**Linen**

All the linen is 100% Egyptian cotton in pure white to keep things simple, all the duvets and pillows are new and anti allergy.

**Security**

Walberswick is a very safe village with little or no crime but even so it is sensible not to be careless all the windows have window locks as do the terrace doors off the conservatory, if you are leaving the house it would be sensible to leave these locked.

**Fire alarm and precautions**

There is a fire alarm on the landing of the first floor, this is battery operated, if it is beeping please let us know, as the battery will be low. We also provide a fire extinguisher and fire blanket in the kitchen.

**PAC testing**

We have all the electrics and electrical goods 'PAC' tested regularly.

**Internet access via WIFI**

We know how important it is to stay in touch these days, so we provide a free WIFI internet access on broad band the access codes are in the house. You will however need to provide your own lap top!

**Smoking**

We ask you to respect our non smoking guests by not smoking in the house.

**Pets**

We are great animal lovers and really understand that you might want to bring your pet on holiday but feel that it is unfair to other guests who may suffer from allergies so we do not allow them, sorry.

**Good house keeping deposit**

As a precaution we ask our guests to pay a good house keeping deposit of 250pounds, this is used to cover any breakages that may occur during your stay, this will be returned to you once Lisa and her team have been through the house, should there be any breakages we will deduct these from it and return you the balance.
