description: ' Elm Gables is a lovely family home in the popular village of Walberswick.  The house is located at the entrance to the village and next to the church, with a large gated and mature garden, which makes the house very private. With three double bedrooms, a large family bathroom with separate shower on the first floor, and a sitting room with working fire place, second TV room for the kids, a large conservatory off the kitchen and a cloak room on the ground floor. In order to make your welcome more pleasant on your arrival there will be some fresh bread, milk and free range eggs left by Joeâ€™s cleaning Team.'
